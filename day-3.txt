and document.writeln used print output in ui
var can be reintialized and redecalred
let can be reintialized and cannot redecalred
const cannot redecalred and reintialized

1.primitive datatype:-it can store single value and they are default 
-String , number,boolen ,null and undefined
2.non-primitive datatype:-it can store multiple values.
