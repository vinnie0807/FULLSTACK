what is javascript ?
it is a high level , loosely typed ,ligthweight and scripting language .
scripting language:- the soure 

* head part in html is not seen enduser in app*
in js console.log is used print output in developer tool
and document.writeln used print output in ui
var can be reintialized and redecalred
let can be reintialized and cannot redecalred
const cannot redecalred and reintialized

types of datatype:-
1.primitive datatype:-it can store single value and they are default 
-String , number,boolen ,null and undefined
2.non-primitive datatype:-it can store multiple values.
-they are user defined.
-functions ,arrays and objects

1.string :- squence of characters enclosed within ""and '' and `` 
2.number:- it stores all the number datatypes such as int ,float value etc..
3.boolean:- true and false
4.undefined:- any variable decalred but not intitalized
5.null:- it empty value

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is javascript?
- JavaScript is a high level , loosely or weakly typed ,lightweight and scripting language.

-scripting languages :- the source code directly read by the interpreter.


applications :- webpages , mobiles apps , smartwatch , gaming , server side app , database .

vairables :-
- variabels are containers / memory block to store values.
types of variables
1.var :- var can be re-intitialized
	-var can be re-decalred
2.let :- let can be re-intitlaized
	- let cannot be re-decalared
3.const :-const cannot be re-intitalized and re-decalred.


ex:-  var a = 10;/ let b=20; / const c = 30;

		console.log(a , b, c);

- javascript file can be created with extension called "filename.js".

console.log() :- this output method is used to check the output in the developer tool / debugging tool

document.writeln() :- this method is used to print the output on the UI.


Datatypes:-
***********
- datatypes used to metion what kind of data used in the variable.

- types of datatypes:-
**********************
1.primitive datatype:- it can store single values.
			- they are default.
			-String  , number , Boolean , null ,undefined
2.non-primitive datatype :- it can store multiple values.
			- they are user defined.
			- functions, arrays , objects

1.string:- sequence of characters enclosed within double quotes / single quotes / backticks(``).
2.number :- it sotres all the number data types such as integer , float values etc...
3.boolean :- true/false .
4.undefined :- any variable decalred but not intitialized.
5.null :- empty of object.

functions:-
syntax :- function function_name(optional parameter){
             // statements
        }
		return value;

Types of the function
1. named function :- which is having name  to decalared and to call the function.
2. anonymous function:- funtion which doesnot name to decalared
3. function expression:- function which is assigned to a variable.
4.immediate invoked function expression(IIFE):- function which is called immediately after decalration.
5.arrow function:- function which is used to reduce the code or reduce syntax.
syntax:- ()=>{};
-it is also similar to anonymous function.
- IT is also called as fat arrow function.
- IT IS USED TO REDUCE THE CODE AND REDUCE THE SYNTAX.
6.higher order function:- 
-higher order function is a function which accepts another function as a parameter or returns a function as a return value.
7.call back function:-
-callback function is fuction which is passed as value or argument to another function.

Note:- curreent version of javascript is ES14.
es - ecmascript
ECMA - European Computer Manufacturers Association.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
return statements:-
it will return either expression or value.

implicit return:- it will return the value without using return keyword.

explicit return:- it will return the value using return keyword.
Note: foreacxh conot be return the value.if we want return value s by using foreach it will give outputas undefined.so for this we can use map method.
where as map can return the value.

-closuer:- closuer is memory created when the function bundled together
by giving accessiblity  to the  inner function to the outer function.


_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

methods of json:-
1.JSON.stringify() :- it is used to convert the object into JSon object.
2.JSON.parse() :- it is used to convert the json object into object.

web storages:-
-it can store the data inside the browser.
-upto 10mb data can be stored.
1.local storage:- it is a permanent storage.
                - it can  store upto 10MB
				methods:-
				1.localStorage.setItem("key","value");
				2.localStorage.getItem("key");
				3.localStorage.removeItem("key");
				4.localStorage.clear();
2.session storage:- it is a temporary storage.
                 - it can store upto 5MB of data.
				 methods:-
				1.session storage.setItem("key","value");
				2.session storage.getItem("key");
				3.session storage.removeItem("key");
				4.session storage.clear();
NOTE : javascript is single threaded language.(synchrounous)
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Asynchronous :- making js to work multiple task at a time.\
1.setTimeout() :- it is used to delay the execution of the function.
				 -syntax:- setTimeout(function_name, time);
2.setInterval() :- it is used to repeat the execution of the function.
                 -syntax:- setInterval(function_name, time);

promise:- it is used to handle the asynchronous operation.
        -it es6 feature.
		status of promise:-
		1.pending:- initial state of the promise. still ongoing.
		2.fulfilled:- operation is successful.
		3.rejected:- operation is failed.
sysntax:- var promise = new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
			// statements
		});
		promise.then(function(){
			// statements
		}).catch(function(){
			// statements
		});

for handle promise we can use then and catch method.
then method is used to handle the fulfilled state.
catch method is used to handle the rejected state.

4.async and await:- 
                   async:- it is used to make the function as asynchronous.
				   await:- it is used to wait for the promise to be settled.

syntax:- async function function_name(){
			await promise;
		}

DOM:- Document Object Model.
what is dom?
-DOM is a wed api used to manipulate the html conmtext.
-Dom is used to add, remove, update the html elements.

                                -it can only traget the single element value.

                                          -it can target the multiple element value.
										  -with class attribute we can use multiple class name.
3.document.getElementByTagName("tagname"):- it is used to get the element by tag name.
4.document.getElementByName("name"):- it is used to get the element by name.
5.document.querySelector("selector"):- it is used to get the element by css selector.this method select only one element.
6.document.querySelectorAll("selector"):- it is used to get the element by css selector.this method select multiple element.

innnerText:- it is used to get the text content of the element.
            -it is used a manipulate only text content.
